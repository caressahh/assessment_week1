*Question 4 - Rspec*
(Please use your text file to put your answers in)
How do you initialize `rspec` in a folder?

Answer: I would need to create a gem file with gem 'repec'
I would also have to run bundle install.

*Question:We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then
written code to make them pass. Why?

Amswer: We would write tests first so we are able to know, specifically,
what we are testing- and how we would like the program to work.
